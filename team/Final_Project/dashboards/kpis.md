# Executive Dashboard: Air Quality Monitoring System

**Dashboard Link:** [ *Insert Looker Studio Link Here* ]

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Current Air Quality Index (Live CO Levels)
*   **Definition:** The real-time concentration of Carbon Monoxide (CO) in Rome, measured in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³).
*   **Source:** Streaming Table (`streaming_air_quality`).
*   **Business Value:** Provides immediate situational awareness of current pollution levels. A value above 10,000 µg/m³ indicates dangerous toxicity.

### 2. Forecast Accuracy (Model Performance)
*   **Definition:** The percent difference between the *Predicted CO* (generated by our 2004 Hybrid Model) and the *Actual Live CO* (from the API).
*   **Formula:** `abs(Predicted - Actual) / Actual * 100`
*   **Source:** Derived from BigQuery ML Predictions.
*   **Business Value:** Validates the reliability of our predictive maintenance and forecasting algorithms.

### 3. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) vs. Ozone (O3) Correlation
*   **Definition:** A scatter plot or ratio comparing NO2 levels against Ozone levels over the last 24 hours.
*   **Source:** Streaming Table (`streaming_air_quality`).
*   **Business Value:** Identifies the type of pollution source. High NO2 usually indicates traffic/combustion, while high Ozone indicates photochemical smog.

### 4. Historical Sensor Reliability Rate
*   **Definition:** The percentage of valid sensor readings (excluding the `-200` error code) in the historical dataset.
*   **Source:** Batch Table (`sensor_data`).
*   **Business Value:** Assesses the quality of the training data infrastructure and identifies if sensor maintenance was adequate during the collection period.

### 5. Hourly Pollution Trend (Time-Series)
*   **Definition:** A line chart showing the fluctuation of CO and NO2 levels over the past 4 hours (Streaming) compared to the daily average from the historical baseline (Batch).
*   **Source:** Hybrid (Streaming Table + Batch Table).
*   **Business Value:** Detects emerging trends (e.g., "Is pollution spiking right now?") allowing for proactive alerts rather than reactive reporting.
