## 1. Exact Contributions

### Air Quality Analysis & Solution Proposal
- Proposed the **air quality analysis direction** for the project, focusing on monitoring pollutant trends (e.g., NOx) using time-series analysis.
- Defined the analytical objective: combining historical and streaming air pollution data to identify temporal patterns and support air quality monitoring.
- Determined key metrics and appropriate time granularity (daily trends) to ensure interpretability and alignment with dashboard visualization needs.

### Dashboard Development (Looker Studio)
- Designed and implemented the **Looker Studio dashboard** for air quality analysis.
- Built time-series visualizations (e.g., Appendix) and supporting KPI components.
- Validated timestamp parsing and aggregation logic using Colab notebooks prior to dashboard deployment.

### Presentation (PPT)
- Created the **final project presentation slides**.
- Communicated the problem context, dataset overview, analytical approach, dashboard results, and key insights.
- Structured slides to clearly present technical findings and managerial implications to a non-technical audience.

## 3. Lessons Learned

- Learned how to translate an open-ended environmental problem into a structured analytical question with measurable outputs.
- Gained hands-on experience validating time-series data in Colab before deploying visualizations in Looker Studio.
- Improved my ability to communicate analytical insights through dashboards and presentation slides.
- Developed a stronger understanding of traceability between notebooks, dashboards, and final presentations in team-based analytics projects.
